## 🕵️‍♂️ **Operation: Hotel Raid**

### _Can You Catch Them All Before It’s Too Late?_

A daring heist has just shaken the city.
**Five thieves** have pulled off a massive bank robbery—and vanished. But luck is on your side: intelligence points to a **suspicious hotel with 15 rooms**, and the trail leads directly there.

As a **dedicated police officer**, it’s your duty to bring these criminals to justice. The thieves are each hiding in **separate rooms**, and you've been granted a warrant to raid the hotel.

But there's a catch:
🚨 **You only have 7 attempts** to uncover the rooms they're hiding in.
🔍 **Each correct find** earns you **+15 points**.
❌ **Each miss** costs you **-2 points**—and valuable time.

Succeed in catching **all 5 thieves within your 7 chances**, and you'll be **honored with medals from the President**.
Fail... and you face **suspension** from the force. Your badge, your pride, your future—it's all on the line.
